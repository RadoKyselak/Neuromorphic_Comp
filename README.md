# Neuromorphic_Computing

The 📈 spiking neural network (SNN) code and 🧠 convolutional neural network (CNN) code both run using 🐍 python by using an MNIST dataset of 🖐️ hand-drawn ✏️ images. Among the packages used were 🔦 torch, 🔦 torchvision 👁️, and 🪼 spikingjelly for the SNN and NumPy and keras for the CNN.

The intention of this code was to 💯 test and ⚖️ compare the efficency of SNNs and CNNs for 🧪 empirical 📜 research purposes.
